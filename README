Couple of helper scripts for creating OSM maps


doCountries.pl - This downloads a bunch of Maps from Geofabrik
Takes path for place to store files

createGarmin.pl - Creates the OSM maps
Takes path to the home

You need the following files

splitter.jar - http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/splitter/
mkgmap.jar - http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/snapshots/


Be sure to provide the right paths within the scripts

The setup is expected to look like this

/path/to/java
..
$home
  \osm
    \garmin
    splitter.jar
    mkgmap-rVERSION.jar
    map-features.csv
  \pub-html
    \osm
      \countries
      country.osm.bz2
      \garmin
        \countries
      	country.gmap.bz2
